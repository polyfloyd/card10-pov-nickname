Card10 POV-Nickname
===================

This app renders the contents of `nickname.txt` by using a Persistence of
Vision effect with the 11 RGB LEDs on the top.

The start of the animation is triggered when the Y axis of the BHI160
accelerometer registers a significant change in its direction, as if the wearer
is swinging their arm when walking.
